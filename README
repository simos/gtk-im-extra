This is the README for gtk-im-extra.

gtk-im-extra is a collection of third party GTK+ input method modules.


COMPILATION

gtk-im-extra uses GTK+ 2.2 or later, which you can get from
http://gtk.org/. 

To compile and install, do the usual

   ./configure
   make
   make install


SETUP

Installation overwrites the system-wide input module cache file,
normally /etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules. (This is the right thing to do,
see http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112099.)

You will want to add ${prefix}/lib/gtk-2.0/$(GTK_BINARY_VERSION)/immodules
the directory where the input modules are installed, to your
system-wide GTK_PATH.
